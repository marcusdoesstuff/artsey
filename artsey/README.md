# YAML Spec and Generators

This folder contains the main YAML definition of ARTSEY as well as Python generators for creating markdown files showing the layout as well as an under-developmetn svg generator.

Please note the markdown files are generated by the Python script `artsey.py`. Please only update the YAML file and run the generator when submitting changes to ARTSEY's layout.
